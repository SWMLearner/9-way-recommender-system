# 9-Way Recommender System

A machine learning course recommendation system originally implementing 9 different algorithms. Currently deployed with 8 algorithms due to Python 3.13 package compatibility.

## Currently Deployed Algorithms (8):
- Course Similarity
- User Profile Matching  
- Clustering
- Clustering with PCA
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Neural Networks
- Regression with Embedding Features
- Classification with Embedding Features

## Temporarily Disabled:
- Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) - awaiting package compatibility

## Features
- Multiple recommendation algorithms
- Personalized course suggestions  
- Interactive web interface with real-time tuning

## Quick Start
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run recommender_app.py
